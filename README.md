# amazonBooks_Scrapy
I have scraped Amazon Book Section using Scrapy(2.6.1) Framework, Python(3.10.0 version) and have stored the scraped data in MongoDB(5.0.9) using Pymongo(4.1.1) library of python
Create a folder for project, you want to scrap and go inside that to create a virtual Env by following command :" Virtualenv ." and activate it by following command: " .\scripts\activate
Virtual Environment is mostly preferd as it keeps the project isolated, whatever packages and libraries needed for that particular project are inside the env. and we can directly deploy them on github by keeping them isolated from whole system.
Then Install Scrapy by typing this command in cmd :" pip install Scrapy" , you can also specify the version of scrapy while installing.
Start Project by typing this command in terminal :" srapy startproject <project-name> and this will create a number of files and folders that includes a basic skeleton to get started quickly:
